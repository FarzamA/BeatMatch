The continuous challenge of exploring new concepts and technologies is one which should be met with excitement and genuine curiosity. The field of computer science consistently forces us out of our comfort zone, leading us towards a never ending and captivating journey where we can always learn more. I'm passionate about building things that are streamlined, beautiful, and easy to use. Whether it's designing an efficient back-end database schema or dynamically rendering React components on the front-end, I’m most engaged when I’m solving problems. I love that full stack software engineering has given me such a great outlet to express creativity both logically and visually."}<br/><br/> {" In my spare time when I'm not building web applications, I’m an avid reader and you can always find me on a trail or playing Starcraft on the weekends. Let me know if you want to chat about code or if you have any solid book/game recommendations - I’m all ears."}

The path I took to get to software engineering is an interesting one. I started off as a chemistry student, with plans to go to dental school, but shortly after I determined that my true passion lies with development once I started to get heavily invested in videos games as well as the technologies used to create servers for multiplayer video games. This lead me to change paths and ultimately pursue my greatest passion which is software engineering/game development."}<br/><br/> {"In my free time I enjoy listening to music and playing video games, specifically FiveM. Although the range of games I play varies based on my mood. I'll play anything from Forza Horizon 5 to NBA 2K21. Musically, I am open to all genres, but mostly I listen to hip hop and even delve in some song creation for myself."}
